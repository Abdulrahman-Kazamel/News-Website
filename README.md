In this project, 
-I have used .NET MVC and jQuery.
-I have used repository pattern to isolate business logic from the Database layer.
-I have used one of Solid principle in Injection , the constroctor depandancy injection, to not create instance myself.
-i tried to go with solid as i could , as using genric reposotory then extened it when needed.
-I refactored the project templete to bootstrap4 
-I also learned in this project the diffrence between diffrent lifecycle of instance creation as siglton (once for whole project),Scoped(Shared per Http Request),Transient(Multipule instance creataion per request)
I have learned the difrence between middlieware and filteres and how each one apply to each request and specfic request and how each context of them diffrent
